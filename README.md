# data_scraping-challenge

There are 2 parts to this challenge.

In part 1, I used firefox to scrape through 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html'.
I then used Beautiful Soup to find and create previews of the news articles I scraped and placed them into dictionaries in my notbeook.

In part 2, I used firefox to scrape through "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html".
I used Beautiful Soup once again to access a table and recreate it into a dataframe in my notebook.
I then modified my dataframe to ensure the proper types were assigned so I could use matplotlib to make fun colored graphs that represented my analysis based on certain questions concerning the data.
I finally wrote a csv file containing the scraped information from the site.
